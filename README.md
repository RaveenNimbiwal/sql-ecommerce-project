# sql-ecommerce-project

This project showcases a complete SQL workflow using a small e-commerce dataset.  
It includes database schema design, data import from CSV files, and a collection of SQL queries ranging from basic operations to advanced analytical questions.  
The goal is to demonstrate practical SQL skills commonly used in data analysis and reporting.


## What This Project Contains

### **1. Database Schema**
The database has four tables:
- customers  
- products  
- orders  
- order_items  

The file `schema.sql` creates all these tables.

### **2. CSV Files**
The `datasets` folder has all the CSV files used to fill the database.  
Each CSV file matches one table.

### **3. SQL Queries**
The `sql/queries` folder has three files:
- **basic_questions_1.sql** → basic questions
- **basic_questions_2.sql** → basic-intermediate questions 
- **advanced_questions.sql** → harder SQL  
- **analytical_questions.sql** → business-style questions
